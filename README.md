# Installing OneShot on Linux

If you're using a Linux-based operating system, the Steam version of OneShot won't work out of the box. You can use this small program to make OneShot run.

To simply launch the game, you must go into OneShot's game directory, for most people,
this is `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/OneShot/`. You have to simply remove the
`librt.so.1` for the game to work.

**This guide assumes you have the Steam version of OneShot already installed, and that your system is properly configured and up-to-date.**
